<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Neeraj Jethmalani, born on the 7th of March, 1992, in the vibrant city of Mumbai, Maharashtra. 
  My journey through life has been an exciting and continuous pursuit of knowledge and growth. With a solid educational foundation, diverse work experience, and a penchant for adventure, I'm constantly striving to make the most out of every moment.
</p>

<p>Education has played a pivotal role in shaping my perspective. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Technology (Btech), which provided me with a strong technical foundation and analytical mindset. Building upon this, I pursued an MBA, refining my business acumen and leadership skills. 
  Additionally, my Project Management Professional (PMP) certification stands as a testament to my commitment to excellence in managing complex projects.</p>

<p>
  For the past five years, I've been immersed in the dynamic world of project management, currently thriving as an IT Project Manager at FulcroWorld. 
  This role has allowed me to harness my technical prowess and managerial finesse to drive successful project outcomes. The challenges and opportunities presented in this field have been a consistent source of motivation for me.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond the professional sphere, I find immense joy in various activities. Physical fitness is a cornerstone of my lifestyle, and you can often find me hitting the gym or gliding through the waters while swimming. I'm a firm believer in the adage "never stop learning," which has led me to take up coding as a new skill. Currently, I'm engrossed in my first coding project, excited about the potential it holds for personal and professional growth.
</p>

<p>
  One of my greatest passions is exploring new places. Traveling allows me to break free from routine and immerse myself in different cultures, cuisines, and climates. Cold destinations hold a special allure, providing respite from the scorching Indian summers and offering a chance to embrace the beauty of winter landscapes.
</p>

<p>
  As I embark on this coding journey and continue to manage projects at FulcroWorld, I'm driven by a desire to make meaningful contributions to both my personal and professional spheres. Life, to me, is a tapestry of experiences waiting to be woven, and I'm eagerly crafting each chapter with enthusiasm and determination.
